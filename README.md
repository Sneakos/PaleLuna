# PaleLuna
Play a spooky text based game

This is an "Escape the Room" type game made entirely by me (Although the term 'Pale Luna' itself is taken from a creepy pasta I read awhile ago)

As of now, it is not complete, although I have the first 2 rooms more or less finished.

And it's pretty damn modular, if I do say so myself
